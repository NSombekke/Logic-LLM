Given a problem and a question. The task is to parse the problem into Linear Temporal Logic formulars and explain your translation step by step.
Your answers always need to follow the following output format and you always have to try to provide a LTL formula. You may repeat your answers.
Remember that X means "next", U means "until", G means "globally", F means "finally", which means GF means "infinitely often".
The formula should only contain atomic propositions or operators |, &, ~, ->, <->, X, U, G, F.

Problem:
Every a is eventually followed by a e.
Question:
The task is to parse the problem into Linear Temporal Logic formulars. Translate the above natural language sentence into an LTL formula and explain your translation step by step.
###
Explanation: 
"Every" from the input sentence refers to the temporal operator "G", meaning that the subsequent part of the input must hold at every point in time, i.e., globally.
"eventually" from the input sentence translates to the temporal operator "F". "a followed by a e" means that after "a" holds, "e" has to hold as well, i.e., translating to an implication.
Thus, "a eventually followed by a e" translates to "a -> F e".
Explanation dictionary: 
{"Every": "G", "eventually": "F", "a": "a", "e": "e", "a followed by a e": "a -> e", "a eventually followed by a e": "a -> F e"}
Conclusion:
G (a -> F e).FINISH

Problem: 
a and b never occur at the same time but one of them holds in every time step.
Question:
"The task is to parse the problem into Linear Temporal Logic formulars. Translate the above natural language sentence into an LTL formula and explain your translation step by step.
###
Explanation: 
"a and b" from the input translates to the conjunction of atomic propositions a,b, i.e., it translates to "a & b".
"a and b never occur" from the input translates to the temporal behavior that at all positions, i.e., globally, neither a nor b hold, i.e., "G(~(a & b))".
The input additionally requires that "one of them holds in every time step", which means that a or b hold globally, i.e., it translates to "G(a | b)".
Explanation dictionary:
{"a and b": "a & b", "a and b never occur": "G(~(a & b))", "one of them holds in every time step": "G(a | b)"}
Conclusion:
G(~(a & b)) & G(a | b).FINISH
