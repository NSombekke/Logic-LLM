    "context": "Our environment is a gridworld with 3 floors, each consisting of rooms made up of grid cells. Each floor has distinct rooms: the first floor contains a red room and a yellow room, the second floor contains a green room, and the third floor includes a purple room, an orange room, and Landmark one. All three floors are connected by a blue room, which is present on each floor. The drone's movement is limited to one floor and not more than one room at a timestep within this structured environment. This setup is crucial for guiding effective planning and decision-making processes within the context of our problem",
    "question": "always avoid the green room and navigate to the third floor. Which one of the following is a possible path for the drone to follow?",
    "answer": "C",
