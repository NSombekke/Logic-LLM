Whenever a and b do not hold, c holds eventually.;G (!(a && b) -> F c); G (!a & !b -> F c);The first formula is covered by the second one.
a and b never occur at the same time but one of them holds in every time step.;G(!(a &&b)) && G(a || b); G (!(a & b)) & G(a | b); Equivalent
Whenever the inputs a and b are the same, the outputs c and d are the same.;G ((a <-> b) -> (c <-> d)); G ((a <-> b) -> (c <-> d)); Equivalent
a can only happen if b happend before;(! a) U b; G (a -> F b); The two formulas are incomparable.
Once a happened, b won't happen again.;G (a -> X G ! b); G (a -> !F b); The first formula covers the second one.
a releases b;(b U (b & ! a)) | G b; G (a -> XF b); The two formulas are incomparable.
a and b won't occur at the same time;G !(a & b); G !(a & b); Equivalent
Whenever a holds and b holds in the next step, then c holds one step after b.;G (a && X b -> X X c); G (a & XF b -> XF XF c)
Whenever a holds, b holds eventually from the next step on.;G (a -> X F b); G (a -> XF F b); The two formulas are incomparable
a holds in every fifth step.;a && G (a -> X ! a && X X ! a && X X X ! a && X X X X ! a && X X X X X a); G (a <-> XXXXF a);The two formulas are disjoint

not a holds at most two timestamps;! G (! (a && X a)); !(XF XF !a); The first formula covers the second one.
a can only hold every three timestamps;G ( a -> (X !a | XX !a | XXX !a)); G (a <-> XXXa);The two formulas are incomparable.
