Given a problem statement as contexts, the task is to answer a logical reasoning question. 
------
Context:
Our environment is a gridworld with 3 floors, each consisting of rooms made up of grid cells. Each floor has distinct rooms: the first floor contains a red room and a yellow room, the second floor contains a green room, and the third floor includes a purple room, an orange room, and Landmark one. All three floors are connected by a blue room, which is present on each floor. The drone's movement is limited to one floor and not more than one room at a timestep within this structured environment. This setup is crucial for guiding effective planning and decision-making processes within the context of our problem.

Question:
always avoid the green room and navigate to the third floor. Which one of the following is a possible path for the drone to follow?

Options:
(A) From the third floor go to the green room and stay there,
(B) Go inside the red room and then move to the green room,
(C) Go to the second floor passing the yellow room and then go to the third floor

Reasoning:
Option A and B visit the green room which violates the condition to always avoid the green room. Option C is the correct answer because it avoids the green room and ends up at the third floor as depicted in the question.

The correct option is: C

Question:
go through the yellow room to the second floor. Which one of the following is a possible path for the drone to follow?

Options:
(A) From the third floor go to the yellow room then move to the green room,
(B) Visit the second floor after going to the red room,
(C) Go to the red room and finally go to the yellow room

Reasoning:
The drone needs to go through the yellow room to the second floor. Option B does not visit the yellow room so it is incorrect. Options C does not visit the second floor as the red room is on the first floor. The correct answer is A as the drone goes to the yellow room and then to the green room which is on the second floor.

The correct option is: A
