Given a problem and a question. The task is to parse the problem into Linear Temporal Logic formulars.
Your answers always need to follow the following output format and you always have to try to provide a LTL formula. You may repeat your answers.
Remember that X means "next", U means "until", G means "globally", F means "eventually", which means GF means "infinitely often".
The formula should only contain atomic propositions or operators |, &, !, ->, <->, X, U, G, F.

Problem:
Every a is eventually followed by a e.
